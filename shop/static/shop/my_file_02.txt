We live in a digital world, and computers are part of almost everything we do. Not so long ago, computers were bulky, noisy machines that lived mainly on desks, but now they are tiny, silent devices hidden inside our phones, cars, TVs, and even watches.  We use them to work, play games, watch movies, go shopping, and keep in touch with our friends and family.
Today’s computers are so simple to use that anyone can operate them. But not as  many people know how to write the code that makes them work. Becoming a coder allows you to look under the hood and see how a computer really works. With a bit  of practice, you can build your own apps, write your own games, or just tinker with other people’s programs and customize your own ingenious creations.
As well as being an addictive hobby, coding is a skill that’s in huge demand all over  the world. Learn how to code and it will set you in good stead wherever your life  leads, whether you’re interested in science, art, music, sport, or business.
Today, there are hundreds of coding languages you can learn, from simple, drag-and- drop languages like ScratchTM to web-programming languages like JavaScript®. This book is based on Python®, one of the world’s most widely used coding languages. Equally popular with students and professionals, Python is easy to pick up yet powerful and versatile. It’s a great language to learn whether you’re a beginner or moving up from a simple language like Scratch.
The best way to learn to code is to get immersed, and that’s how this book is designed  to work. Just follow the numbered steps and you’ll be building apps, games, graphics, and puzzles in no time. Learning to code is easier if you’re having fun, so we’ve tried  to make the projects as much fun as possible.
If you’re new to programming, start at the beginning and work your way through.  Don’t worry if you don’t understand every detail—it doesn’t matter. The more projects you build, the better you’ll get. And don’t worry if your programs don’t work the first time you run them. Even the pros have to debug their work.
Once you’ve finished building each project, there are tips on how to tweak and adapt  it. Feel free to try your own hacks. With a little bit of imagination and skill, there’s  no limit to what a coder can achieve.
